# {{PROBLEM}} Function Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

## 2. Design the Function Signature

_Include the name of the function, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

```python

```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the function will take and return._

```python

```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._

Here's an example for you to start with:

```python

```

Ensure all test function names are unique, otherwise pytest will ignore them!
